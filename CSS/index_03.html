        Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
        A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
        However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory,
        and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.
        Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc
